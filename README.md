# Simple Summation Function (using a loop):

 - This method uses a loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to n and accumulates their sum.
 - Advantages: Simple, easy to understand, and suitable for small values of n.
 - Disadvantages: Can be less efficient for large values of n due to the need for iteration.


# 2. Recursive Summation Function:

 - This method uses recursion to calculate the sum by breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems.
 - Advantages: Elegant and concise code, suitable for small to moderate values of n.
 - Disadvantages: Can lead to a stack overflow for very large values of n due to the recursive calls.

# 3. Mathematical Formula Implementation:
 - This method utilizes a mathematical formula for the sum of consecutive integers to directly calculate the sum.
 - Advantages: Extremely efficient, constant time complexity, suitable for any value of n.
 - Disadvantages: Requires knowledge of the formula, may not be as intuitive for readers without a mathematical background.
 - This formula is based on the Arithmetic Progression.
